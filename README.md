# imodmob

This repository contains the ideas, prototypes and artefacts of the project "Intermodale Mobilit√§t" of the Zunkunftsstadt-Workshop Dresden (2017).

You can find the flyer for the project [here](../master/documentation/flyer/flyer.pdf).

## How it should feel (under construction)

This section describes how the system should be presented to and used by an end user who wants to go from A to B in a way, which suits him best.
